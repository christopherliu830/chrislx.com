I started programming with Python at 11 making small text adventure games. I graduated from NYU with a major in CS, and after a couple of jobs across the country I moved to (and currently in) Japan, now studying computer graphics. I'm passionate about programming for low-level systems and graphical effects. Currently I'm enjoying Zig, but have experience in all sorts of languages and frameworks.
